# Data Science Projects 🧠📊

This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects built using Python. Each folder represents an individual project complete with source code, notebook, dataset references, and documentation.

## 📁 Project List

### 🔹 [Belarus Car Price Prediction](./belarus-car-price-prediction)
Predicting the prices of used cars in Belarus using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models. Includes full EDA, model comparison, and evaluation.

### 🔹 [Breast Cancer Prediction](./breast-cancer-prediction)
A classification project using machine learning algorithms to identify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features from digitized images of a breast mass.

### 🔹 [Crop Yield Prediction](./crop-yield-prediction)
This regression project predicts crop yield based on environmental factors like rainfall, temperature, and humidity using algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees.

### 🔹 [Customer Churn Prediction](./customer-churn-prediction)
Predicting customer churn using classification models based on customer behavior and demographic data. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, and model performance analysis.
