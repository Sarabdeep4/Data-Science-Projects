# Heart Stroke Prediction ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

## Overview
This binary classification project predicts the likelihood of a person experiencing a stroke based on health metrics.

## Problem Statement
Early detection of stroke risk can help save lives and reduce healthcare costs by enabling timely medical intervention.

## Dataset
Features included:
- Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease
- BMI, Smoking Status
- Work Type, Residence Type
- Glucose Level, Gender

## Approach
1. Data preprocessing:
   - Handling missing BMI values
   - Encoding categorical variables
2. Applied various classification models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
3. Used cross-validation and ROC-AUC score for model evaluation.

## Results
The Logistic Regression, SVM and KNN model achieved an accuracy of **93.8%**.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Heart Stroke Prediction.ipynb`.
