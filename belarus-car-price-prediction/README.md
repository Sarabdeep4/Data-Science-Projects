# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project uses the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a tumor is **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)** using logistic regression.

## 📌 Overview

This notebook walks through:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluation Metrics
- Final Model Comparison and Conclusion

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains listings of used cars for sale in Belarus.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/belarus-car-price-prediction.git
   cd belarus-car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   Open `Belarus Car Price Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

## 📈 Visuals
