# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave a service) based on their behavior and demographic features using machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify patterns in customer behavior and build a predictive model that helps businesses retain valuable customers.

## 🔍 Overview

- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building and Evaluation
- Model Optimization

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Handle missing values and categorical encoding.
3. Split the data for training and testing.
4. Train multiple classification models.
5. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.
6. Select the best model for deployment.

## 📈 Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **0.87**, demonstrating reliable predictions in identifying potential churners.

## 🚀 Getting Started
