# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction

This project focuses on predicting crop yields based on multiple environmental and agricultural parameters using supervised machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict crop yield using features like temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil type.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning (Regression Models)
- Model Evaluation and Tuning

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Workflow

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis.
3. Apply feature scaling and encoding.
4. Split data into training and test sets.
5. Train regression models and evaluate using R² score, MAE, MSE.
6. Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## 📈 Results

The best-performing model achieved an R² score of `0.802` on the test set, showing reliable prediction capabilities for crop yield forecasting.
