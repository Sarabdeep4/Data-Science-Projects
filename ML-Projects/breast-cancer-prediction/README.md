# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project uses the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a tumor is **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)** using logistic regression.

## 🧠 Objective

To accurately classify breast cancer tumors using key features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: `data.csv` (from the UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- Features include:
  - Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, etc.
- Target variable: `diagnosis` (M = malignant, B = benign)

## 🔧 Methods Used

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model
- Evaluation with accuracy score

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-prediction.git
    cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   Open `Breast Cancer Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.
